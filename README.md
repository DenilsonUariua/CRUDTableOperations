## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Microsoft SQL Server installed and running.
2. A database (e.g., `CarsDatabase`) created in SQL Server.

### Create the Cars Table
Run the following SQL script to create the `Cars` table in your database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Cars (
    CarID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,  
    Make NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,           
    Model NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,         
    Year INT NOT NULL,                   
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);
```

### Insert values into the Cars Table
Run the following SQL script to insert 10 cars into your table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Cars (Make, Model, Year, Price) VALUES
('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2020, 20000.00),
('Honda', 'Civic', 2019, 18000.00),
